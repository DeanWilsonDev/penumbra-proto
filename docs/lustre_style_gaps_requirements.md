# Feature request: style-surface gaps found scoping Lustre

> **Status:** Request, not yet scoped or implemented. Filed during Lustre's design handoff
> (`../../lustre/docs/lustre_handoff.md` §3) — not blocking that design; Lustre's spec includes
> these properties/selectors now and stubs them at the application boundary until Penumbra
> grows the equivalent support, per that doc's growing-together principle.

## 1. Interaction-state (hover/pressed/disabled) styling is Button-only today — DONE

> Implemented: `BoxStyle` now carries `ColorBackgroundHovered`/`ColorBackgroundPressed`/
> `ColorBackgroundDisabled` (zero alpha = no override, matching the existing
> presence-flag convention). `ButtonStyle` no longer redeclares them — inherited from
> `BoxStyle`. `Box::UpdateInteractionState`/`Box::Draw` now track `InteractionState` and
> resolve a state-driven background the same way `Button` already did, so any
> `onPress`-capable `Box` (Iris's `<Frame>`) gets `:hover`/`:active`/`:disabled` styling
> without needing to be a `Button`. `Button`'s own detection logic is unchanged, just
> reading the colours off `Style` instead of separate duplicate fields.

`Widgets/Styles.h`'s `BoxStyle` (used directly by `Frame`, and as the base every other style
struct extends) has no interaction-state fields at all — no hover/pressed/disabled colors,
borders, or anything else. Only `ButtonStyle` adds
`ColorBackgroundHovered`/`ColorBackgroundPressed`/`ColorBackgroundDisabled`; `CheckboxStyle`
adds none. Lustre's `:hover`/`:active`/`:disabled` pseudo-class selectors are being designed
to apply to *any* classed element, matching how Iris's own interactivity model already treats
event props (`onPress` etc.) as valid on any element, not just `Button` — see
`iris/docs/iris_core_spec.md` §4's "a `Frame` with an `onPress` prop is an interactive frame."
Lustre resolving a `:hover` rule against a `Frame`- or `Checkbox`-classed element currently has
nowhere to put the result.

### What would unblock this

Interaction-state color fields (hover/pressed/disabled, matching `ButtonStyle`'s existing
three) moved down onto `BoxStyle` itself, so every widget type gets them for free, the same
way `Padding`/`Margin`/`BorderRadius` already are universal box-model slots rather than
per-widget additions. `Button`'s own interaction-state detection (`UpdateInteractionState`,
already tracking hover/press/disabled from `InputState` per frame) wouldn't need to change —
only widgets that want to *use* the new fields (starting with `Frame`, given it's the
`onPress`-capable general-purpose container) would need their own
`Draw`/interaction-detection logic extended to read them, mirroring `Button`'s existing
pattern.

## 2. No transform primitive of any kind — DONE

No scale, translate, or rotate exists anywhere in `Renderer`, `WidgetBase`, or any style
struct. Lustre's spec includes `transform: scale(...)` as a real property (documented, not
omitted) because it's a common enough styling need (press-state feedback, hover lift) that
leaving it out of the language entirely felt wrong even though nothing can execute it today —
see the old Lustre design draft's own `:active { transform: scale(0.97) }` example, which
doesn't compile to anything real right now.

> Implemented: `Transform` (`ScaleX/Y`, `TranslateXLogical/YLogical`, `RotationDegrees`,
> identity default) lives in `Geometry.h` alongside `Point`/`Rect`, and `BoxStyle::Transform`
> exposes it -- one flat field, not a per-state Hovered/Pressed/Disabled trio like the
> interaction colours (resolving e.g. `:active { transform: scale(0.97) }` into this field
> per frame is a resolver-side concern once the primitive exists). Transform-origin is always
> centre, and layout is untouched -- matches CSS: transform never reflows.
>
> Drawing: `Box::Draw` redirects a transformed Box's own paint plus every descendant into an
> offscreen texture (`Renderer::PushTransform`/`PopTransform`), composited back as one
> `SDL_RenderTextureRotated` blit -- reusing the render-to-texture pattern `ViewportWidget`
> already established rather than threading a transform matrix through every `DrawFilledRect`/
> `DrawText`/etc. vertex computation. This is why children (e.g. a Label inside a scaled
> Frame) visually transform for free, text included, at the cost of only affecting the
> primitives Box/Label's own paint path actually uses (`DrawFilledRect`, `DrawRectOutline`,
> `DrawGradientRect`, `DrawText`) -- a subtree relying on `DrawRadialGradient`/`DrawDropShadow`/
> `DrawLine`/`DrawTriangleFilled`/`DrawTexture` directly won't transform with it in this first
> cut. Nested transforms compose naturally (each Push/Pop composites into whichever target --
> window or an ancestor's own capture -- was active when it was pushed), and the outer
> target's clip is cleared for the capture and restored on Pop since it doesn't apply to the
> new texture's coordinate space.
>
> Hit-testing: `Box::UpdateInteractionState`/`Button::UpdateInteractionState` inverse-transform
> the mouse point around the widget's own centre before testing `ArrangedRect`, so clicking
> tracks the visual position. The common (untransformed) path pays nothing extra -- no
> `InputState` copy, no trig -- since `Transform::IsIdentity()` short-circuits before either.

## 3. No fixed-size (width/height) override anywhere — DONE

`WidgetBase`/`Box`/`Label` size themselves entirely intrinsically — `Measure`/`Arrange` derive
size from content plus `BoxStyle::Padding`, with no field anywhere to say "be exactly 200
logical pixels wide regardless of content." Lustre's spec includes `width`/`height` as real
properties (two of the most basic in CSS, and Lustre's explicit design goal is CSS
familiarity) even though nothing backs them today.

### What would unblock this

An explicit-size-override concept distinct from intrinsic `Measure` — e.g. optional
`WidthLogical`/`HeightLogical` fields (or a `SizeMode` enum: `Intrinsic` vs `Fixed`) that
`Measure` consults before falling through to content-driven sizing. Not proposing exact field
names here; this needs its own design pass alongside whatever `<Grid>`'s real layout mode ends
up needing (`iris_core_spec.md` §9's own open gap), since both touch `Measure`/`Arrange`.

> Implemented: `BoxStyle::WidthLogical`/`HeightLogical` (`-1`, "auto", the default; a value
> `>= 0` is the exact border-box size, `Padding`/`BorderWidth` included). `Box::Measure`
> consults them twice -- once to override what it hands its own content/children as available
> space (a fixed-width container constrains its children to its own width, not whatever the
> parent offered, matching CSS), and once to override what it reports upward regardless of
> what that content-driven calculation produced. `<Grid>` is still just a stub (`Box` with
> `LayoutMode::HorizontalStack`, per `iris_core_spec.md` §3.1/§8) with no real layout mode of
> its own yet, so there was nothing concrete to design alongside; nothing here is Grid-specific
> and revisiting it if/when Grid gets real layout is a follow-up, not a blocker.
>
> Scope: only `Box::Measure` consults these fields, which is also every widget that reuses it
> unchanged (`Button`, `Checkbox`, `Label`, `TextInput`, `NumericDrag` -- exactly the
> `WidgetBase`/`Box`/`Label` scope this item named). Widgets with their own bespoke `Measure`
> override (`IconWidget`, `ImageWidget`, `ViewportWidget`, `InlineContainer`,
> `ScrollablePanel`, `SplitPanel`) don't consult it -- each has its own sizing semantics
> (glyph size, aspect ratio, scroll content, split ratio) that a generic override wasn't asked
> to touch.
>
> Known interaction, not fully reconciled: on the layout MAIN axis (a `VerticalStack`'s height,
> a `HorizontalStack`'s width) a fixed size always wins, since it's baked into what `Measure`
> reports and the stack just sums those. On the CROSS axis, `CrossAlign::Stretch` still
> overrides an explicit size unconditionally, the same way it already overrode intrinsic
> sizing before this existed -- real flexbox reconciles `align-self`/explicit-size precedence
> more carefully; doing the same here is a follow-up, not part of this primitive.

## 4. Not a gap, confirmed working as-is

Penumbra's `Button::UpdateInteractionState` already does its own hover/press/disabled
detection per frame from `Platform::InputState` — Lustre/Iris will never need to detect
interaction state themselves for any widget, only supply a complete resolved style struct once
per class change. Recorded here so it's clear this *isn't* part of the gap — worth confirming
the same holds if/when item 1 above extends interaction-state fields to `Frame`/`Checkbox`.
